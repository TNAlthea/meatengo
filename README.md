Meatengo is a multi-site built with Vue 3 as the front-end and Laravel API as the back-end. Meatengo is a grocery store that has all your daily needs, water; food; snacks; you name it. Meatengo's application has three core functionality.

# Admin panel
Admin's panel consists of several components such as 'add_inventory'; 'dashboard'; 'inventory_management'; and 'log in' that serve purposes as its name suggests. However, there is no 'register' page because of security concerns.

## add_inventory
The 'add_inventory' component is where the admin registers a new product into the database.

## 'dashboard'
The 'dashboard' component shows all data summaries from the cashier app such as transactions; sales; inventory records, and marketplace statistics. The dashboard helps Admin/Owner monitor and improve business performance with quick data visualization.

## 'inventory_management'
The 'inventory_management' shows all product data in the database also admins are able to alter product data if necessary.

# Cashier apps	
Admin's panel consists of several components such as 'dashboard'; 'checkout'; 'transaction_record'; 'member_register'; and 'log in' that serve purposes as its name suggests. However, similar to admin, there is no 'register' page because of security concerns. 

## dashboard
The dashboard is like usual cashier applications where the cashier can perform user transactions.

## checkout
The checkout purpose is to double-check the user's cart before conducting the transaction, selecting the preferred payment method, and finalizing the order.

## transaction_record
The transaction_record shows all transactions record.

## member_register
the member_register is where the cashier is able to create new memberships whenever the customer wants to register.

# User marketplace
will be implemented later (coming soon)
